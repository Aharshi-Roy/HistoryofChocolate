        <h1> History of Chocolate</h1>
        <h2> How chocolate was made </h2>
        <p> As most people know, chocolate is made out of cacao beans. Cacao beans are from the Americas. The first civilization to discover chocolate was the Olmec. But their chocolate was different from ours.
            Chocolate was a beverage, and it was considered sacred. Also, cacao beans were used as currency.

        <h2> The Europeans arrive</h2>
        <p> When the Europeans first arrived, they were very skeptical of the chocolate. Girolamo Benzoni said "it seemed more a drink for pigs". But then, the Spanish realized how to make chocolate more tasty.
            They added sugar and spices. By the early 17th century, the recipes had traveled to Europe.
        </p>
        <p> The Spanish, French, and Italians embraced this drink, but England was more reluctant. It wasn't until 1655 that the English realized how good the chocolate was. </p>
        <h2> The Chocolate Bar</h2>
        <p> It starts with the decreasing price of chocolate. Before, chocolate was only for wealthy people, and not available for the common. But new technologies would change that. Before, the beans were grounded by hand.
            But manufacturers started using steam powered machines, which lowered the cost. In 1828, Dutch chemist Coenraad Johannes Van Houten discovered a way to turn beans into a powder.
            This meant chocolate could be mass produced, and was available to more of the public. In the mid-19th century the Quaker chocolate dynasty Fry & Sons, developed a way to make a paste that could be made into a bar.
            This is considered to be the first chocolate bar.

        <h1> Conclusion </h1>
        <p> Today, there are many brands of chocolate such as Hershey's, Reeses, and much more. Chocolate is one of the most biggest categories of candy, and is enjoyed by millions of kids.
            Chocolate has a fascinating history, and I hope you learned something new.
